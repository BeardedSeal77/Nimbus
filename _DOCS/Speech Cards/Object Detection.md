Object Detection Core Method
The detect method accepts two inputs: a target object name from the voice command and a video frame from the drone's camera. It runs YOLO inference on the frame using GPU acceleration and FP16 precision at 640x640 resolution, then iterates through all detected objects to find a match for the target. When a match is found, the method extracts the bounding box coordinates in xyxy format - the top-left and bottom-right corner points. It converts these to a more usable dictionary containing x position, y position, width, and height, then returns this coordinate data back to the Central Hub. If the target object isn't found in the frame, it returns an empty dictionary.
