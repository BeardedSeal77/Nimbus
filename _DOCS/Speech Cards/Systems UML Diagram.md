Central Hub Architecture
The Central Hub acts as the communication backbone for our drone system, built as a Python Flask server. It receives raw video and position data from the simulation or physical drone, then distributes this information to specialized subsystems including AI processing, Mixed Reality interfaces, and robotics control modules. The Hub manages bidirectional data flow - sending PID translation commands back to the drone, forwarding processed video to MR displays, and providing real-time position and object detection data to the robotics subsystem. This centralized architecture ensures all components stay synchronized and can share critical flight and sensor data.
