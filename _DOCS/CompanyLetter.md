Dear NTSU Aviation Team,

We are writing to formally introduce our university project and request your collaboration as previously discussed.

## Project Overview

Our group, VIR-Group 2 from Belgium Campus, is developing an innovative NLP Powered Drone system. The project enables natural language commands such as "go to the chair," whereupon our system:

- Processes the video feed to identify and locate the target object
- Calculates distance and movement parameters
- Directs the drone to the specified location
- Provides real-time video feedback with spatial information through MR/VR interfaces

## Current Limitations

Our university has provided a DJI Tello Drone for development. While functional, this basic model presents significant limitations:

- Fixed camera positioning
- No built-in spatial awareness capabilities
- Absence of ROS2 integration
- Limited SLAM functionality

These constraints require us to develop complex software-based SLAM systems using video feed analysis alone, which significantly impacts project scope and accuracy.

## Collaboration Proposal

We respectfully request collaboration with NTSU Aviation to enhance our project through access to Enterprise Grade DJI drones. These advanced systems offer:

- Native ROS2 compatibility
- Built-in SLAM capabilities
- Enhanced spatial awareness
- Superior location data extraction
- Improved overall system reliability

## Meeting Arrangement

We plan to visit your facilities in the coming week, pending confirmation, to discuss:

- Available drone models and specifications
- Potential sponsorship opportunities
- Technical capabilities alignment with our project requirements
- Collaboration framework and timeline

## Conclusion

This collaboration would significantly advance our research capabilities while providing NTSU Aviation with insights into cutting-edge NLP drone applications. We look forward to exploring this mutually beneficial partnership.

Thank you for your consideration and support of our academic endeavor.

Sincerely,

VIR-Group 2
Belgium Campus
NLP Powered Drone Project Team
