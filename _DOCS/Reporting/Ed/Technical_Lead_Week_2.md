**Name:** Erin David Cullen
**Date:** Week 2 (21 July - 08 August)
**Date:** ____________________

‚úÖ 1. Work Completed (Since Last Report)
_What you‚Äôve built, implemented, tested or reviewed and an estimate as to how many hours it took to complete
‚Ä¢ AI module development and integration (~12-16 hr)
‚Ä¢ ROS2 video feed implementation (~4 hr)
‚Ä¢ Docker container setup and configuration (~4 hr)

‚Ä¢ **Feature/Module:** AI Processing System Integration
  - Implemented individual AI processing modules (object detection, speech-to-text, intent processing, depth analysis, RTAB-Map SLAM)
  - Built main AI.py system to subscribe to ROS2 video feeds and process frames
  - Created ROS2 video publisher to stream camera feeds into ROS2 container

‚Ä¢ **Tools/Libs Used:**
  - ROS2 Humble with rosbridge websocket
  - OpenCV for video processing
  - YOLOv8 (ultralytics) for object detection
  - Whisper (transformers) for speech-to-text
  - WebSocket for ROS2 communication
  - Docker containers for modular deployment

‚Ä¢ **Outcome/Results:**
  - Successfully implemented video feed pipeline: Camera ‚Üí ROS2 Container ‚Üí AI Processing ‚Üí Display
  - AI modules can run independently and process video/audio inputs
  - Established WebSocket-based communication between containers
  - System can receive and display video frames from ROS2 with processing overlays

‚Ä¢ **Contributions (if applicable):**
  - Built AI.py main system with frame processing pipeline
  - Implemented object detection node using YOLOv8
  - Created speech-to-text node using Whisper
  - Developed ROS2 video publisher for camera feed integration
  - Established container communication architecture ‚ÄÉ

üö® 4. Issues & Risks
_Bugs, technical debt, resourcing, or anything threatening progress._

| Issue | Impact | Suggested Action | Owner |
|-------|--------|------------------|-------|
| Low latency video inputs | Video feed unreliability affects real-time processing | Lower the latency and improve the stability and reliability | Ed |
| ROS2 container isolation | Difficult integration with Python-based project components | Design ROS2 bridge/API for Python communication | Ed |
| Live video processing challenges | Object detection on continuous feed vs single images | Optimize processing pipeline and implement frame skipping | Hayley |

üìà 5. Key Insights / Recommendations
_Lessons learned, suggestions, architecture notes, or optimizations._

‚Ä¢	WebSocket-based communication between Docker containers proved effective for modular AI system architecture
‚Ä¢	Individual AI modules (YOLO, Whisper) work well in isolation but integration complexity increases with real-time constraints
‚Ä¢	ROS2 Humble container serves as reliable central hub for video/audio data distribution across system components
