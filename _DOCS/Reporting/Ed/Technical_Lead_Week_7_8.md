üö® 4. Issues & Risks
_Bugs, technical debt, resourcing, or anything threatening progress._

| Issue | Impact | Suggested Action | Owner |
|-------|--------|------------------|-------|
| Partnership dependency | Project success now heavily dependent on NTSU Aviation collaboration | Maintain software-only backup plan and diversify hardware options | Team |
| Unknown drone specifications | Cannot plan integration without knowing exact drone model and capabilities | Prioritize meeting scheduling and technical specification gathering | Ed |
| Project scope uncertainty | Unclear how much current codebase will remain relevant with enterprise drone | Document all current implementations and plan modular adaptation | Team |
| Timeline disruption | Hardware transition may delay project milestones and deliverables | Adjust project timeline and communicate changes to stakeholders | Ed |
| Over-reliance on external hardware | Losing access to drone could halt project progress entirely | Maintain parallel development paths for software-only and hardware-integrated versions | Team |
